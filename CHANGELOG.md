## 1.1.2 ‚Äî Style Polish & Render Boost  
**Release Date:** July 28, 2025  

### ‚ú¶ What's Improved

* **‚†ø Braille-Style Headings:** Headings are now styled using simplified Braille characters.

* **üé® Terminal UI Polish:** Refined visual styling for core elements, making the terminal output cleaner and easier to read.

* **‚ö° Faster, better Image Rendering:** Minor performance boost in image rendering. Using Lanczos resampling algorithm for better image quality, less pixelated.

* **üìÑ Another Code Structuring Chage:** All code except `main.py` are moved to `core/` for better control.

## 1.1.1 ‚Äî Bug Cleanup & Render Refactor  
**Release Date:** July 27, 2025  

### ‚ú¶ What's Fixed

* **üêõ Double Title Bug:** Fixed an issue where `title` elements were rendered **twice** due to overlapping logic in the main render flow and separate title rendering. Titles now appear once, clean and correct.

* **ü™ù Anchor-In-Container Fix:** Anchors inside wrapped containers (like `<table>`) no longer cause layout glitches. They now behave more predictably in block and inline contexts.

### üõ† Refactoring & Structure

* **üß© Code Modularization:**  
  * Moved ANSI formatting to `ansi.py`  
  * Moved image rendering logic to `utils/image_render.py`  
  This makes future maintenance easier and separates concerns cleanly.

* **üìÑ Project Structure Enhancements:**  
  * Added missing project docs: `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` ‚Äî making this project ready for contributors and safer for public use.

## 1.1.0 ‚Äî Dynamic Dashboard & Clickable Magic
**Release Date:** July 26, 2025

### ‚ú¶ What's New

* **‚ú® Interactive Links with `click` Command:** You can now navigate directly within the terminal using **`click <id>`**. Anchor element will show its id in [] bracket. This significantly improves the user experience, making sections and widgets feel more interactive and alive.

* **Live Weather ~~and News~~ Integration:** Your homepage and dashboard now pull **real-time weather ~~and news data~~** directly from external APIs, keeping you informed right from your terminal.

* **UI Enhancements:**
    * **Improved Section Titles:** We've reworked section titles using box-drawing Unicode characters to create a stronger visual hierarchy.
    * **Layout Refinements:** You'll notice minor layout adjustments and a more polished loading experience.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

* **Anchor Element Layout in Wrapped Containers:** When using `anchor` elements inside wrapped containers (like `<table>`), you might encounter layout or styling issues due to overflow or inline-block behaviors. We recommend testing them outside of strict block structures.

* **Duplicate Title Rendering on Terminal Render:** When rendering elements with `title` headers, the title is displayed twice due to overlapping logic between the main render function and seperate title rendering logic.

* **News API isn‚Äôt working properly:** The dashboard is currently using a temporary (pseudo) text while I sort out an issue with the real one.
