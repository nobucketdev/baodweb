## 1.2.5 ‚Äî Semantic Navigation Fix & Smart Layout
**Release Date:** August 2, 2025

### üõ† Fixes
- **Nested Link Parsing in `<nav>`:**  
  Resolved an issue where non-container tags inside `<div>` or `<section>` inside a `<nav>` were ignored. Navigation bar now recursively picks up valid inline elements only.

- **Navigation Layout Overflow:**  
  Navigation bar now **dynamically adjusts width** based on actual content, preventing ugly terminal overflow or full-width stretching.


### ‚úÖ Improvements.
- Navigation rendering accepts inline-style tags only (e.g., `<a>`, `<button>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, etc.)
- Safer, cleaner, semantic nav rendering with fallback for complex structures.

---

## 1.2.4 ‚Äî URL Resolution Fixes
**Release Date:** August 2, 2025

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed: Relative vs Global URL Confusion**  
  Corrected the logic that was misinterpreting relative URLs as global ones (vice versa), improving navigation and resource handling.

---

## 1.2.3 ‚Äî Source Polish & Layout Fixes  
**Release Date:** August 2, 2025

### ‚ú® Improvements  
- **Refined Source View Rendering**  
  Enhanced the `source` command output for better formatting consistency and reduced color bleed on malformed tags.  
  Now handles complex attributes and nested tags.

- **Modular Button Rendering**  
  Buttons now inherit from the `Box` base class, ensuring consistent layout and easier future structuring updates.  
  This change improves modularity across UI components.

- **Relative URL Support**  
  Link like a href="/about" can now be handle correctly.


### üêû Bug Fixes  
- **Navigation Duplication**  
  Fixed a bug where `<nav>` tag in header could appear twice in the rendered output.  
  Now renders only once, preserving semantic structure.

- **Complex Tags Rendering Compatibility**  
  Improved partial rendering support for tags with complex or densely packed attributes.  
  These are now displayed more cleanly instead of defaulting to raw HTML dump.

---

## 1.2.2 ‚Äî View Source 
**Release Date:** August 1, 2025

### ‚ú® Feature Additions
- **View Raw HTML with Color Highlighting:**  
  Added a new `source` command that displays the original HTML of the current page.  
  Uses syntax-aware formatting:
  - üü¶ **Tag names** in blue  
  - üü† **Attributes and values** in orange
  - ‚ö™ **Text content** in white  
  - ‚¨ú **Brackets and slashes** in gray  

  This makes it easy to inspect and debug page structure directly from the terminal.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Raise
- Some complex tag with many attribute can be not rendered as normal, it will show full HTML code.

---

## 1.2.1 ‚Äî Two Structural Semantic Tags Supported 
**Release Date:** August 1, 2025

### ‚ú® Feature Additions
- **Header & Footer Support:**  
  Added native handling for `<header>` and `<footer>` tags.

- **Early Access: Search Engine Integration:**  
  Introduced basic search support using a hybrid engine setup.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Old bugs still not fixed.

---
## 1.2.0 ‚Äî Alpha Polish  
**Release Date:** July 31, 2025

### üßº Visual & Code Polish  
Refined the layout, cleaned up code.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **List-Table Layout Conflict:**  
  Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) inside tables still break alignment. No fix yet ‚Äî avoid if you value structure.

- **Alt Text Duplication:**  
  Long `alt` texts may still repeat when scrolling.

---


## 1.2.0-alpha ‚Äî Layout & Render Overhaul  
**Release Date:** July 30, 2025

## ‚ú¶ What's New

### üìè Just-Fit Terminal Rendering  
The browser now intelligently adjusts content rendering to *precisely fit* your terminal's height ‚Äî no more chopped-off content. It‚Äôs all tight, all clean.

### üß≠ Command and Title Bars

- **Bottom Command Bar:**  
  A persistent command input bar now stick at the very bottom of the terminal.

- **Top Title Bar:**  
  A dedicated title bar is now fixed at the top of the screen, showing the current page‚Äôs title to make navigation more intuitive.

- **üìù "About" Page:**  
  New `about.html` available! Type `test about` or `click 4` on dashboard to open.

## ‚ö° Performance & Stability

- **Optimized Rendering:**  
  Major speed boosts and smoother rendering.

- **Minor Issue Fixes:**  
  Patched various bugs and annoying glitches. Overall UX is now less janky and more joyful.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **List-Table Layout Conflict:**  
  List like `<ul>` or `<ol>` inside table cells (`<td>`) may break alignment. Expect a bit of chaos if you do that.

- **Alt Text Duplication on Scroll:**  
  Sometimes, scrolling causes long `alt` texts to show up twice.

## 1.1.2 ‚Äî Style Polish & Render Boost  
**Release Date:** July 28, 2025  

### ‚ú¶ What's Improved

* **‚†ø Braille-Style Headings:** Headings are now styled using simplified Braille characters.

* **üé® Terminal UI Polish:** Refined visual styling for core elements, making the terminal output cleaner and easier to read.

* **‚ö° Faster, better Image Rendering:** Minor performance boost in image rendering. Using Lanczos resampling algorithm for better image quality, less pixelated.

* **üìÑ Another Code Structuring Chage:** All code except `main.py` are moved to `core/` for better control.

---


## 1.1.1 ‚Äî Bug Cleanup & Render Refactor  
**Release Date:** July 27, 2025  

### ‚ú¶ What's Fixed

* **üêõ Double Title Bug:** Fixed an issue where `title` elements were rendered **twice** due to overlapping logic in the main render flow and separate title rendering. Titles now appear once, clean and correct.

* **ü™ù Anchor-In-Container Fix:** Anchors inside wrapped containers (like `<table>`) no longer cause layout glitches. They now behave more predictably in block and inline contexts.

### üõ† Refactoring & Structure

* **üß© Code Modularization:**  
  * Moved ANSI formatting to `ansi.py`  
  * Moved image rendering logic to `utils/image_render.py`  
  This makes future maintenance easier and separates concerns cleanly.

* **üìÑ Project Structure Enhancements:**  
  * Added missing project docs: `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` ‚Äî making this project ready for contributors and safer for public use.

## 1.1.0 ‚Äî Dynamic Dashboard & Clickable Magic
**Release Date:** July 26, 2025

### ‚ú¶ What's New

* **‚ú® Interactive Links with `click` Command:** You can now navigate directly within the terminal using **`click <id>`**. Anchor element will show its id in [] bracket. This significantly improves the user experience, making sections and widgets feel more interactive and alive.

* **Live Weather ~~and News~~ Integration:** Your homepage and dashboard now pull **real-time weather ~~and news data~~** directly from external APIs, keeping you informed right from your terminal.

* **UI Enhancements:**
    * **Improved Section Titles:** We've reworked section titles using box-drawing Unicode characters to create a stronger visual hierarchy.
    * **Layout Refinements:** You'll notice minor layout adjustments and a more polished loading experience.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

* **Anchor Element Layout in Wrapped Containers:** When using `anchor` elements inside wrapped containers (like `<table>`), you might encounter layout or styling issues due to overflow or inline-block behaviors. We recommend testing them outside of strict block structures.

* **Duplicate Title Rendering on Terminal Render:** When rendering elements with `title` headers, the title is displayed twice due to overlapping logic between the main render function and seperate title rendering logic.

* **News API isn‚Äôt working properly:** The dashboard is currently using a temporary (pseudo) text while I sort out an issue with the real one.
