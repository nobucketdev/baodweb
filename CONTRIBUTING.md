# Contributing to BaodWeb

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

BaodWeb is currently maintained by a single developer, but thoughtful contributions — including code, feedback, and issue reports — are welcome. This document outlines the guidelines for participating in the project.

## Project Scope

BaodWeb is an experimental terminal-based web browser written in Python. The emphasis is on minimalism, performance, and control over rendering, rather than feature-completeness.
